# Port Scanner
A demonstration of how you might build a Port Scanner for KS4 and KS5 pupils.

## Introduction
This code should be straightforward for pupils that have a basic understanding of Python and reinforces basic programming constructs such as selection and iteration.

I have tested this on Python 3.1X with MacOS and Windows, but you do need access to the command line interface (CLI) so it may be a question of demonstrating it to pupils rather than them running it themselves.

## Packages Used
We will be using:
* [socket]() to 

To install these packages, you should use Python's package installer, pip3.  On the MacOS CLI you can use these commands:
```
pip3 install socket
```
